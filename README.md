## External content
The file at [`external/gamecontrollerdb.txt`](./external/gamecontrollerdb.txt) is not my work - it is sourced from [this GitHub repository](https://github.com/mdqinc/SDL_GameControllerDB) and covered by the appropriate license present in said repository.

## Usage
You will need to specify the BIOS file to run with, using the `--bios` command-line argument. Note that there is such a BIOS ROM present in this directory at [`./external/gba_bios.bin`](./external/gba_bios.bin).
