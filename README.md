Nintendo GameBoy Advance â„¢ emulator and debugger, written in rust.

# Build and usage

1. set-up rust *nightly*
2. Obtain a gba bios binary. you can get an [open source GBA bios](https://github.com/Nebuleon/ReGBA/blob/master/bios/gba_bios.bin)
3. Place the bios file in the repository root and name it `gba_bios.bin`

4. Build and run in release mode (performance is terrible in the `dev` profile)
    ```bash
    $ cargo run --release -- path/to/rom
    ```

# Why is this project needed ?

It's actually **not**. There are quite a lot of GBA emulators, ~~and even some written in rust~~. Actually, I couldn't find any game capable emulators written in rust.

I'm only doing this as a side project intended for learning rust.

This is my *third* take on this project. My first go at this was about 3 years ago, but I didn't like rust much at the time so it got abandoned.
I tried to resurrect it a year ago but didn't have the time to get invested in a side-project, let alone learning rust.

I've grown to like rust a lot since then, so here we go again.
You know what they say, *third time's a charm*.

# Progress

## Supported features:
* Display modes 0,4,5
* PCM Audio channels

## Todo:
